Random name picker. Great for raffles, lotteries, etc.

Add your list of names to the file random-names.txt. Each name should be on it's own line and avoid using punctuations like commas, semi-colons, question marks, etc. since I haven't fully tested it out yet. Commas will definitely cause a problem and hyphens will work. 

Requires PHP but only because I haven't figured out how to read a text file in javascript and have it outputted to the page.
